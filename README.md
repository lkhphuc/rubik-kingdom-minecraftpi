This repo contains code for the project of class CE4, of CS2014 taught by Richard Bradley.  
It's a rubik-themed Minecraft Pi mod call **Rubik Kingdom**

The game mod is run on a Raspberry Pi with Minecraft Pi running.
Simply execute the python script while Minecraft is running and you can see the changes made by the script happen in game.

You also need to connect the Raspberry Pi with a Numpad to be able to play the mini game: 2D Rubik in the Kingdom.
